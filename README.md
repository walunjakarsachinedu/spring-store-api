## Features

- CRUD operations for Products, Categories, Users
- Data validation using Spring Validation
- Global exception handling
- DTO mapping with MapStruct

- Role-based access control (Admin/User)


## Tech Stack

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3+
- Spring Security, JPA, Validation
- MapStruct
- MySQL
- JWT
- Swagger

## Running the App

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or use your IDE to run SpringStoreApiApplication.

## Code Organisation

This project uses a feature-first approach to package organization:

> Organize by feature first, then by layerâ€”only when a layer has multiple elements.
> 
> e.g., For example, in the auth feature, multiple DTOs (like LoginRequest, JwtResponse) are grouped under:
> ```java
> package com.codewithmosh.store.auth.dtos;
> ```


## API Documentation
